I'm a bioinformatician who combines data science skills.
My current position at Aummune Ltd. is that of a Bioinformatics researcher, and I am pursuing my Master's degree at Tel Aviv University,
At the moment - final stages, I work with both Python and R. I plan to do more public projects in the future.
Bioinformatics and healthcare data science are my main interests.
